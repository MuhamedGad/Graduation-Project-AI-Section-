# Farm Vision AI Models

This repository contains the AI models used on our graduation project, Farm Vision. The project is about using drone and AI technologies to help farmers monitor their crops and detect plant diseases and fruit quantity. The project also includes a website and a flutter mobile app for each user.

## Models

The models are trained using PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. They are deployed on the drone using NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The models can perform the following tasks:

- Plant disease detection: This model can identify various plant diseases such as leaf spot, powdery mildew, anthracnose, etc. It can also classify healthy and unhealthy plants.
- Fruit quantity estimation: This model can count the number of fruits on a tree or a plant using object detection and segmentation techniques. It can also estimate the size and ripeness of the fruits.
- Crop health assessment: This model can evaluate the overall health and quality of the crops using various indicators such as leaf color, shape, texture, etc. It can also detect pests and weeds.
